        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          ImportsAdvisorKE was conceived from a deep understanding of the
          challenges faced by Kenyan importers, a landscape often characterized
          by opaque costs, fluctuating rates, and complex regulatory hurdles.
          Recognizing the critical role imports play in the national economy,
          our founders, envisioned a digital solution to demystify this process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The journey began in early 2024, driven by the belief that technology could bridge information gaps and
          empower businesses. Initial development focused on core functionalities: a real-time exchange rate converter
          and a simplified tax estimator. Through iterative development and a commitment to user-centric design, 
          ImportsAdvisorKE evolved into the comprehensive platform it is today, continuously integrating more features like
          logistics cost estimation, financing insights, and essential documentation checklists. Our aim has always been to 
          transform the import experience from a daunting task into a clear, predictable, and efficient journey, contributing 
          to Kenya's economic vibrancy one
          successful import at a time.
